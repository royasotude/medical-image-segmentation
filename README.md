## 1. Problem Statement
Gastrointestinal cancer patients often undergo radiotherapy as part of their treatment regimen. This therapeutic approach is designed to deliver precisely targeted radiation to tumors while sparing healthy tissues, such as the stomach and intestines. However, the challenge arises from the daily variations in tumor and organ positions, which necessitate the manual delineation of these organs by medical professionals.

This manual segmentation process is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also extends the duration of treatment sessions. For patients already coping with the challenges of cancer, the added treatment time can be physically and emotionally taxing.

To address this issue, there is a compelling need to automate the segmentation process in medical images, particularly for identifying the stomach and intestines. Deep learning methods offer a promising solution to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of this critical step in radiotherapy. By automating the identification and delineation of these organs, deep learning can significantly reduce the time required for this process, ultimately shortening treatment sessions and improving the overall experience for patients battling gastrointestinal cancer.

The provided image showcases a compelling example of the need for deep learning-based segmentation. Within this image, the stomach and intestines are distinguishable, but the complex contours and variations in shape pose a formidable challenge for manual delineation.
